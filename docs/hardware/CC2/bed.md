# CC2 Bed

!!! Danger
    The Bed runs on mains AC current at 110/220 V. **These voltages may be lethal.** Exercise extreme caution around the bed and SSR board.

## Bed Heating SSR Board

[Like the CC1](../CC1/bed.md/#bed-heating-ssr-board) the CC2 uses a solid state relay (SSR) board to control the mains bed heating.

The bed is its own Klipper MCU and some pressure sensors [similar on the CC1](../CC1/bed.md/#bed-leveling-board). However on the CC2 board does not use four discrete HX711 amplifiers for strain gauge polling as on the CC1 but instead has a single amplifier IC.
