# Updates

## Updating locally (via USB)

1. Download a firmware from one of the package URLs in the [Firmware update archive](#firmware-update-archive) section.
2. Rename the just downloaded file to `update.bin`.
3. Plug in a USB thumb drive and put `update.bin` on the root of the USB.
4. Plug the USB into the Centauri Carbon and power it on.
5. Accept the update prompt.

Note: Instead of using `update.bin`, you can also use `update/update.swu`.

## Decrypting & Unpacking updates
*Need a hint on where to find the decryption key and iv? Look inside the python file...*

1. Download a firmware from one of the package URLs in the [Firmware update archive](#firmware-update-archive) section.
2. Run [the unpack.py python script](../assets/unpack.py) to unpack the update
    - Usage: `python unpack.py <filename> <key> <iv>`
    - Note: Needs the openssl commandline installed
    - Alternatively, use the online unpacker below
3. You will get an `update.swu` file. You can open this file in 7zip. This archive contains all partitions that will be replaced during an update.

The Centauri Carbon makes use of an A/B partition scheme. When an update is applied, the update is applied to the inactive slot. After the update is applied, the machine switches A/B around so the next boot uses the previously inactive slot. The Centauri Carbon makes use of `swupdate` for updates.

Internally, the following commands are used, where %s is the path to the .swu file:

- A->B: `swupdate -i %s -e stable,now_A_next_B -k /etc/swupdate_public.pem -p reboot &`
- B->A: `swupdate -i %s -e stable,now_B_next_A -k /etc/swupdate_public.pem -p reboot &`

## Firmware update archive

The Centauri Carbon during startup checks [an endpoint on chituiot.com](https://mms.chituiot.com/mainboardVersionUpdate/getInfo.do7?machineType=ELEGOO%20Centauri%20Carbon&machineId=0&version=1.1.0&lan=en&firmwareType=1) to check if a new firmware update is available. Below are archives of what this endpoint provided at the stated date.
