# CC2 update archive

## Updating locally (via USB)

1. Download a firmware from the [Firmware update archive](#firmware-update-archive) section.
2. Plug in a USB thumb drive and place the downloaded file in the root directory of the USB drive.
    - You do not need to decrypt/unpack this update. Place the `.zip.sig` file on the USB.
3. Plug the USB thumb drive into the Centauri Carbon 2.
4. Navigate to Settings, `Check for Updates`, `Offline Update`, and select the downloaded update.

## Decrypting & Unpacking updates

*Note: This is for firmware research only*

The Centauri Carbon 2 delivers updates in a `.zip.sig` format. The `.sig` layer appears to be an encryption and metadata wrapper. Inside the zip, two files can be found:

- `*.swu.sig`: The update package.
- `*.json.sig`: Metadata information (such as version details) about other files in the zip.

The Centauri Carbon 2 employs an A/B partition scheme managed by `swupdate`. Updates are written to the inactive slot, which then becomes the primary boot partition upon the next restart.
