This firmware works well with [modified machine start and end gcode in OrcaSlicer](./modified_start_end_machine_gcode.md), which centers the purge line and turns on the chamber light at print start. Installing this is optional but recommended.

## Update

You can either accept OTA updates directly on the device or repeat the steps in the [Installation section](#install-patched-firmware).

## Uninstall

Follow the steps again in the [Installation section](#install-patched-firmware). In the installer, select `Install Official` > `Install 1.4.46 (Online)`.
