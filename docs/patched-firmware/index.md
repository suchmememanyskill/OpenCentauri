If you find bugs or want to suggest new features, please use the [cc-fw-tools](https://github.com/OpenCentauri/cc-fw-tools){target="_blank"} repository. Not everything is possible within the limits of patching existing firmware, especially large features or full overhauls.

If you'd like to support our work, you can do so on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/opencentauri) :heart:! If spending money isn't your thing, we also have a [Makerworld page](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1924078-opencentauri-logo#profileId-2064746) where you can throw some boosts towards!

!!! warning "**Looking for Full Klipper/COSMOS?**"

    This is regular OpenCentauri patched from official Elegoo firmware. For the full Klipper/Kalico firmware with COSMOS go [here](../klipper-conversion/cosmos/cosmos.md)

!!! warning "Winding down"
    The patched firmware will stop receiving active updates soon. It remains installable and usable, but new features are going into [COSMOS](../klipper-conversion/cosmos/cosmos.md) instead, and users who want continued feature development are encouraged to move over. If you need support, feel free to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/t6Cft3wNJ3).

## FAQ

??? question "**What is OpenCentauri patched firmware?**"

    A modified version of Elegoo's official CC1 firmware (based on 1.4.46 as of v0.4.0) that adds bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and developer features — without replacing the underlying software stack.

??? question "**What does the patched firmware get me that stock firmware doesn't?**"

    - SSH access (user: `root`, password: `OpenCentauri`)
    - Developer tools including a package manager and the ability to prevent Klipper from booting
    - Configurable boot logo
    - Exhaust fan no longer turns on automatically during prints
    - Homing position changed to front right to prevent USB toolhead cable damage
    - WebUI accepts modifications during a print (backported fix from 1.1.42)
    - WebUI store button removed and logo replaced with OpenCentauri branding
    - Z offset can be adjusted while the printer is idle
    - Files can be uploaded while printing
    - Filament usage reported via the API
    - Outgoing connectivity checks blocked
    - OpenCentauri OTA updates instead of official Elegoo updates
    - USB Ethernet adapter support
    - New gcode commands: `M8212`/`M8213` for chamber light and `TEMPERATURE_WAIT SENSOR=box`

    See the [Features page](./features.md) for the full annotated list.

??? question "**Why was the homing position changed to the front right?**"

    The stock front-left homing position routes the USB toolhead cable in a way that causes wear and eventual failure over time. Homing to the front right keeps the cable in a less stressful position and significantly increases its lifespan.

??? question "**Do I need any extra hardware?**"

    No. The patched firmware runs entirely on stock hardware. Only a FAT32-formatted USB drive is needed for installation.

??? question "**Does it work with the CANVAS multimaterial upgrade?**"

    Yes, from v0.4.0 onwards. That release rebased the OpenCentauri patches onto Elegoo 1.4.46, the official firmware that introduced CANVAS support, so multi-color printing behaves the same as it does on stock. v0.3.0 and earlier were based on 1.1.40 and are only compatible with non-CANVAS CC1s on the older mainboard — if you have CANVAS or a printer with the newer Wi-Fi chip, use patched firmware v0.4.0 or newer (or stock 1.4.42 or newer).

    If you would rather drive CANVAS from a full Klipper stack, [COSMOS](../klipper-conversion/cosmos/cosmos.md) supports it through AFC.

??? question "**Is this the same as COSMOS?**"

    No. Patched firmware is still based on Elegoo's official software stack with targeted patches applied on top. [COSMOS](../klipper-conversion/cosmos/cosmos.md) is a full replacement firmware based on Klipper/Kalico that gives complete control over the hardware, and is where active development is now focused.

??? question "**Is it compatible with the Centauri Carbon 2?**"

    Not currently. The patched firmware is based on Elegoo's CC1 firmware. CC2 support is not available at this time.

??? question "**How do I install it?**"

    Instructions are on the [Install page](./install.md).

??? question "**How do I update it?**"

    You can accept OTA updates directly on the printer screen, or repeat the installation steps. See the [Install page](./install.md#update).

??? question "**How do I uninstall it?**"

    Follow the installation steps again and select `Install Official` > `Install 1.4.46 (Online)`. See the [Install page](./install.md#uninstall).

??? question "**Does installing the patched firmware break my warranty?**"

    While we cannot say with certainty what Elegoo's position is, we have not heard of any reports of customers being denied warranty service or part replacements after installing third-party firmware such as OpenCentauri.

??? question "**What do I do if I find a bug?**"

    Open an issue on the [cc-fw-tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenCentauri/cc-fw-tools) with a description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. You can also drop by the [OpenCentauri Discord](https://discord.gg/t6Cft3wNJ3) to report it.

??? question "**How can I support the project?**"

    You can make a one-time or monthly donation on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/opencentauri), or boost our models on [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1924078-opencentauri-logo#profileId-2064746)!
